# Free-Hand

## Project Overview
This is an ongoing embedded systems development project utilizing a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W to implement real-time computer vision, sensor integration, and motor control. I am creating a practical framework for developing and testing embedded C++ applications for autonomous vehicle systems.

## Technical Stack
- **Hardware**: LewanSoul Smart Car Chassis Kit with Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W integration
- **Primary Language**: C++ (emphasizing low-level system programming)
- **Computer Vision**: Custom implementation for gesture recognition processing
- **Sensor Integration**: Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance algorithms

## Core Implementation Features
### Computer Vision System
I am developing a real-time gesture recognition engine for vehicle control that will include:
  - Forward motion (closed fist detection)
  - Directional control (orientation detection for left/right steering)
  - Emergency stop (open palm detection)
  - Reverse operation (inverted thumb gesture recognition)

### Embedded Control Architecture
The project will feature:
- Direct hardware interfacing with motor controllers
- Real-time processing of sensor data for reactive navigation
- Optimized computational resource management for SBC constraints
- Multi-threaded operation handling concurrent vision and sensor systems

### Sensor Fusion
I am implementing:
- Integration of multiple input channels for environmental awareness
- Collision prevention through proximity detection
- Decision tree implementation for obstacle avoidance

## Development Objectives
Through this project, I am exploring:
- Resource-constrained embedded software development
- Real-time computer vision implementation in C++
- Hardware abstraction layer design
- Sensor calibration and fusion techniques
- Efficient power management for mobile platforms

## Technical Challenges I'm Addressing
